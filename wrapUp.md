# Wrap Up Questions

1. A Python library is a collection of code that has been prewritten, usually including several functions.
To include a library in your code, type "import library_name as reference", where the reference is what you will use in your program to access the functions of that library.
To use a function in an imported library, type "reference.function_name()" to access the function in that library.
2. Elements of a circuit that are in series are on the same electrical "path".
If the power supply is cut off, all elements of the circuit will lose power. 
If there is one failure in the circuit, all elements following the failure will fail as well
Elements of a circuit that are in parallel are on separate paths.
If one path of the circuit fails, the others will continue to operate.
3. You cannot create a circuit of three lightbulbs in series because they each will require electricity.
In the series circuit, the first lightbulb will consume some electricity to light itself.
Each lightbulb in series afterward will receive less electricity, unable to light all of them.
